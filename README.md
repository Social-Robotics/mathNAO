# Feedback by a humanoid Robot tutoring math
This code belongs to my master thesis from the TU Delft, which can be found here: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6d4c4b0d-3f25-4d40-8802-17ccc0aae694

The code provides three packages:
- Training package
- Feedback package
- Non-feedback package

Each package corresponds with one of the test scenarios.

The folder `tsjoetsjoewa` contains the files needed for NAO to perform the Tsjoe Tsjoe Wa dance.

TO RUN: upload repo onto Nao (using ssh session), and run shell scripts to start (and log data) for different versions.
